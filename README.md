# MetroDataset

This data set contains both normal and failure datasets of metro bogies. We collected X, Y and Z axis vibration acceleration data of bogies at a sampling frequency of 1024. The data set includes about 50.8 minutes of normal data and 101.4 minutes of failure data. </br>

### Document description: </br>
Two energy harvesting sensor nodes was used to collect the vibration acceleration data from two metro bogies. One bogie is in normal state and the other is in a failure state. The experiments was carried out without passengers to ensure the maximum safety. A 3-axis accelerometer is used in each sensor node to collect 3-axis vibration acceleration data. The normal dataset is in the **Normal** folder. And the failure dataset is in **Failure** folder.
